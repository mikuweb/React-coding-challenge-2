// Question: How can I cover entire screen with background of the modal?
// Quesition: position: relative; ‚ÜêWhy? I don't understand how it works.

// 4) Make a component that displays a button with the text "Open Modal".
// When the button is clicked a div should appear in the center of the page,
// above all other things on the page (position: absolute or position: fixed can help here).
// That div should have a box-shadow so it appears like it's floating.
// Inside this div there should be a text: "Hello, I am a Modal" and a button with the text "Close".
// When the "Close" Button is clicked, the div should disappear again.
